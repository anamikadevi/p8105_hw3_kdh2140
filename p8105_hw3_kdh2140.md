Data Science Homework 3
================
Kristina Howell

The following settings and libraries will be used throughout the
homework.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6, 
  fig.asp = .6, 
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis", 
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "virirdis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_color_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Problem 1

Load the datasets from the p8105 library.

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

### Dataset Description

The dataset **instacart** contains information about specific orders
from the instacart online grocery service with 1,384,617 observations
from 131,209 unique users. Key variables in the dataset include
*department*, *aisle*, *product\_name*, and *order\_id*, as well as
various entries representing time, day of week, and days since prior
order.

Overall, the dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns. Each column
represents an individual item ordered from a user. For example, the
first 8 rows represent:

  - the *order\_id* 1
  - from *user\_id* 112108
  - includes items from *department* “dairy eggs”, “produce”, and
    “canned goods”
  - featuring *product\_name* “Bulgarian Yogurt” ( *product\_id*: 49302
    ) and *product\_name* “Organic Celery Hearts” ( *product\_id*: 10246
    )

The **complete list of variables** in the dataset is as follows:
order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order, reordered, user\_id,
eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow, order\_hour\_of\_day,
days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name, aisle\_id, department\_id,
aisle, department.
